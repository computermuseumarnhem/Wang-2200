I'd like to get this thing working again.

Therefore:

## Extension cards

I've created extension cards to be able to raise the the processor and interface cards out of the card cage. The boards are 8" (203.20 mm) long 
and 2.50" (63.5 mm) wide. In total three extension cards are needed for a full processor board, and two for an interface card, or the power regulator
card.

Features are:

- The card is raised outside the card cage and rotated 90 degrees (component side up). That makes it easy to probe signals with a multimeter or oscilloscope.
- A standard 2x15 0.1" header is provided that connects to all connection points on the card edge, for easy attachment of logic analyzer probes
